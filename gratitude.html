                “I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.”<br>

                One thing I have been working on as a spiritual discipline is gratitude. This can especially hard when you are in the thick of things but I think that is the point of gratitude, to remind you of God's faithfulness before and His continued faithfulness now. He has heard our prayers and answered them before, now we only have to trust and endure and He will do as He always has.

                “In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.”<br>
                Ecclesiastes 7:14

                This verse reminded that all the days of my life are an opportunity to experience God's creation and gift of life. I think it is very hard to find joy in the hard days but knowing and reminding myself of the fact that each day is a blessing helps me stay grounded. I also think this verse speaks to how we know nothing of what is to come so life should be lived as a continual experience of God's grace and mercy - an opportunity to appreciate the nuances of the life God made for you.
