                “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.”<br>

                This verse is kind of mind boggling to me sometimes but reassuring in its own way. The reason I found it mind boggling was because it implies that things can happen by chance but God is in charge of that chance. I think it is reassuring though because it means even something as random as chance is intentional and sincere from God.

                "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."<br>
                Hebrews 12:1-2

                There are many times where I fell short of my own expectations of my faith, or became overwhelmed by the an idea that my faith was something I owned and had to grow by trying harder or simply being better. But this verse encourages me to keep running, to lay aside those difficult sins and weights not simply because I want to better myself, but because of Jesus, who suffered and died with joy for me. The verse also encourages me that I am not alone. Jesus is the founder of my faith, and he will continue to be there to guide me, and to perfect me.

                I think of this verse almost every time I run (literally). Throughout college, there were definitely many moments when I felt weary and weak. But this verse always reminds me not to lean on my own understanding or strength, but to look to JESUS--the founder and perfector of our faith. He is the reason we run this spiritual race, and He is the one who will renew our strength. We need endurance to run this race, and it doesn't come overnight. It comes from continually coming to Jesus and saying "I need you." I hope this verse brings hope and comfort to anyone who needs a reminder of WHY and HOW we can persevere together as followers of Christ

                Life is hard… but I promise you, if you follow God your path will be made straight. Because He promises that. “My teacher, he makes life simple. Every morning I wake up, my ideas and fears are jumbled, I feel overwhelmed with doubt and regret. But if I just pause for a moment and remember. I have only one thing to do today. Follow him. The rest takes care of itself.” - Disciple Matthew in “The Chosen” S4 E2

                “Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.”<br>
                James 5:13-16

                Prayer has been and continues to be the most powerful way to know the character of God and communicate with Him. Prayer CARRIED me through my undergrad years and made me realize my dependency on God through every circumstance. True prayer allows us to know God more!! Even if it's a little prayer in the morning to start your day, aligning your heart with God is what allows you to keep your eyes on Him through every season. Never ever underestimate the value of the secret place.
