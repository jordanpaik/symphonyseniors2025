                This verse is kind of mind boggling to me sometimes but reassuring in its own way. The reason I found it mind boggling was because it implies that things can happen by chance but God is in charge of that chance. I think it is reassuring though because it means even something as random as chance is intentional and sincere from God.

                "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."<br>
                Hebrews 12:1-2

                There are many times where I fell short of my own expectations of my faith, or became overwhelmed by the an idea that my faith was something I owned and had to grow by trying harder or simply being better. But this verse encourages me to keep running, to lay aside those difficult sins and weights not simply because I want to better myself, but because of Jesus, who suffered and died with joy for me. The verse also encourages me that I am not alone. Jesus is the founder of my faith, and he will continue to be there to guide me, and to perfect me.
