                “...even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day. for darkness is as light with you. for you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made...”<br>
                Psalm 139

                whom shall i fear? even when i am covered in darkness and feel as though i am living in hell, the Lord is there and his way is bright and full of peace. he has me safe and sound since before i was even created. He knows my heart and my desire and will shine his light for me to escape from the clutches of all evil.

                “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”<br>
                John 14:27

                This verse really spoke to me as I was wrapping up the semester and wondering where I was headed. The semester ended well despite the chaos and I think this verse really reminds me of the peace that God gives us that is given freely and that lasts. I think it is easy to get caught up in things that are temporal and forget that God's peace which lasts forever is with each of us and that is where our strength and comfort should come from.

                “I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”<br>

                When I was going through a really terrible time in college, this verse was such an encouragement for me. I thought there was something I was doing wrong that was bringing trouble, and that I had the power to prevent it. While in some cases struggling is avoidable, it is important to know that struggling is a part of life. I want to share this for those who are struggling, in this world we will continue to struggle, it is promised, but know that Jesus has overcome this world for us. We are able to have peace knowing that in our struggles we are covered by Him!

                "Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you."<br>
                1 Peter 5:7
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This was a verse that I was reminded of last semester during FG, and it became such a source of strength for me during my senior year of college. Peter reminds us that we should never feel alone when we're anxious. There is a God who is available 24/7 that wants you to cast all anxieties on Him! No need to schedule a time to meet, or worry if you're oversharing. He is awaiting your prayers because He loves and cares for you more than you can imagine.

            <p class="description">
                I feel like it's so easy to be filled with anxiety during college. There are so many things to be excited about, but I know how easy it is to feel alone, purposeless, and unsuccessful when it seems like everyone around you is doing so well. This verse was one that really grounded me during my time in college and reminded me that there is someone greater who is always by my side, cheering me on, and helping me out. God has such a great plan for us, and Isaiah 41:10 reminds us that when we walk with God, He will give us the strength to succeed.

                how great the Father's love for us! what on earth can overcome the power of the cross and the all mighty Lord of all creation? though the trials we face can be so consuming and fill our entire vision, I encourage you guys to look up to the heavens and see and know that the Lord's face is shining down upon you with all the love and grace he has in his heart.

                “Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation. God, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer's; he makes me tread on my high places.”<br>

                I grew up listening to this song and I felt like even years later the Holy Spirit would bring this up whenever I felt lost as He is our firm foundation, our rock, and our source of strength so even if everything around us seems to be falling apart, we can find peace and refuge in who God is and His promises to us!

                Keeping the Lord by our side ensures us that we are secure, walking with Him, as we traverse through our own lives. He wants YOU to know that, He wants YOU to trust in Him. Through every season, through the turmoil, the joyous times, the Lord will always be there. Right next to you.

                I know it can be really hard sometimes to see the good in stressful and anxious circumstances, but the Lord is with you. He is always covering us and strengthening us. He guides us, even when it feels like nothing is going right in our lives. As you all (especially underclassmen) grow and experience more, you'll come to recognize that God was—and is—with you every step of the way. You've got this!

                I think we all experience anxiety during certain seasons of our lives. This verse really encourages me to seek God and His goodness during those times. Highly recommend meditating over this one.

                Ephesians 3:20

            <p class="description">
                During my 4 years of college, I've gone through many seasons of doubt and discouragement, believing that what I saw in front of me was the limit to what could be. Time and time again, God has proven me wrong and shown me that His ways are higher than mine. So whenever you are feeling hopeless or in a tough situation that seems bleak, remember that the real limitation isn't your situation but your lack of imagination. God can indeed do far more abundantly and exceedingly than you expect. Hope not in what you see, but in the Holy Spirit who is at work within you
