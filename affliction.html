                “...even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day. for darkness is as light with you. for you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made...”<br>
                Psalm 139

                whom shall i fear? even when i am covered in darkness and feel as though i am living in hell, the Lord is there and his way is bright and full of peace. he has me safe and sound since before i was even created. He knows my heart and my desire and will shine his light for me to escape from the clutches of all evil.

                “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”<br>

                This verse really spoke to me as I was wrapping up the semester and wondering where I was headed. The semester ended well despite the chaos and I think this verse really reminds me of the peace that God gives us that is given freely and that lasts. I think it is easy to get caught up in things that are temporal and forget that God's peace which lasts forever is with each of us and that is where our strength and comfort should come from.
