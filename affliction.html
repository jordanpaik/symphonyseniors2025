                “...even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day. for darkness is as light with you. for you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made...”<br>
                Psalm 139

                whom shall i fear? even when i am covered in darkness and feel as though i am living in hell, the Lord is there and his way is bright and full of peace. he has me safe and sound since before i was even created. He knows my heart and my desire and will shine his light for me to escape from the clutches of all evil.

                “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”<br>

                This verse really spoke to me as I was wrapping up the semester and wondering where I was headed. The semester ended well despite the chaos and I think this verse really reminds me of the peace that God gives us that is given freely and that lasts. I think it is easy to get caught up in things that are temporal and forget that God's peace which lasts forever is with each of us and that is where our strength and comfort should come from.

                “I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”<br>

                When I was going through a really terrible time in college, this verse was such an encouragement for me. I thought there was something I was doing wrong that was bringing trouble, and that I had the power to prevent it. While in some cases struggling is avoidable, it is important to know that struggling is a part of life. I want to share this for those who are struggling, in this world we will continue to struggle, it is promised, but know that Jesus has overcome this world for us. We are able to have peace knowing that in our struggles we are covered by Him!

                how great the Father's love for us! what on earth can overcome the power of the cross and the all mighty Lord of all creation? though the trials we face can be so consuming and fill our entire vision, I encourage you guys to look up to the heavens and see and know that the Lord's face is shining down upon you with all the love and grace he has in his heart.
