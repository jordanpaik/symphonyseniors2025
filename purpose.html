                “Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.”<br>
                Ecclesiastes 11:9
            </p>

                I really like this verse because it reminds me that youth is something to be enjoyed and experienced to the full. It is very easy to get caught up in habit, obligation, and service that we forget that this life was meant to be experienced not performed. We are to live and enjoy life with Christ not depriving ourselves of what He has said is good for us to enjoy. So have fun! Live life, within reason, freely and with exuberance.
