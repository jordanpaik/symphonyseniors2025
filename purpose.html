                “Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.”<br>
                Ecclesiastes 11:9

                I really like this verse because it reminds me that youth is something to be enjoyed and experienced to the full. It is very easy to get caught up in habit, obligation, and service that we forget that this life was meant to be experienced not performed. We are to live and enjoy life with Christ not depriving ourselves of what He has said is good for us to enjoy. So have fun! Live life, within reason, freely and with exuberance.

                “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.”<br>

                Having a more loving attitude towards others helped me grow so much throughout college.  Being more open and trying to love people allowed me to develop genuine relationships with sisters and brothers in the church and walking together with them has been such a blessing. Loving one another is sometimes hard but is important to hold on to because one act of love can come back to you ten times the amount you gave them. Loving others, as well as loving myself and God, helped strengthen my faith and I hope it does for you too.

                “One thing I have asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple.”<br>

                This was the theme verse for TFTK 2024, and this TFTK was so special to me because it was where I realized that the reason for my life, what God is calling me to do, is not a certain type of serving or ministry, but to simply dwell in His presence. Something about being like Mary and sitting at His feet and learning from Him brings you more peace and joy than anything else. You don't have to strive and work and toil all the time to please the Lord! All He desires is your heart.

                So much of college is figuring out who you are and your becoming. Amidst the noise of being told YOU can shape who you are and what you can achieve makes who you are...or at least determines your worth, I think a great verse to ground yourself in is Galatians 5:22-23. That instead of looking to external flashy things (which aren't necessarily bad! but at the end of the day, meaningless), look to what God commends which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit. Do you look upon others with love? Are your words kind? Be a ray of sunshine like Lebron :] spark joy

                “I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”<br>
                Romans 12:1-2

                In college, it gets really easy to get distracted and look to other things and people to ground and support you. It was so easy for me to be influenced by the people around me and at the time I didn't even realize that was happening. But this verse really challenged me to think about the ways that I might be living and how often I am more like the world. We're not called to look like the world around us, but to be holy and set apart. This verse really convicted me and at the same time gave me the confidence to live for God in every part of my life. I pray it does the same for you too :]

               “Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.”<br>

                I chose this verse because even though you guys might feel young, discouraged, or overlooked sometimes, you have real influence and the power to make a difference right now too. I love you guys and I don't know where God will take me a year from now, but hopefully I'll be a YA at Symphony.

                “Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”<br>

                For so much of my college years I really wrestled with this seemingly never-ending question of what is God's will for my life and if I'm even walking in it and/or following it well. One day when I was venting out my frustrations to my mom, she pointed me to this verse. I realized that there isn't always going to be a specific direction that God wants me to follow. This verse explains it so simply and so well. God's will is for you to rejoice, pray, and give thanks. Abide in Him daily and you are already on the right path to obeying His will for your life.
