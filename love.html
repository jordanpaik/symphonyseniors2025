                “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” <br>
                1 Corinthians 13:7
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Love is such a hard thing to grasp, but when truly the sacrifice that God made through Jesus is known, that is when true joy and happiness comes, so always seek him out with everything no matter the season you are in, because He loves you guys!

                “...As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust...”<br>
                Psalm 103
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                For the moments that you think or feel that God turns his face away from you in anger, let these verses remind you that in our weaknesses (and we have many) that God looks on you with compassion. The whole Psalm 103 is great to read to understand the faithfulness of Gods love in our mess ups.

                “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!”<br>
                Psalm 139:23-24
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This verse struck me during a time when I couldn't fathom depth of Gods love. I see the Trust that David has with God to be willing to reveal himself to God, knowing His heart is Kind and motives towards us always pure. I hope this verse is a source of joy to those who want to hide from God, that God actually wants you to turn towards Him in your brokenness. The whole of Psalm 139 points to the unfailing love of God. I recommend it!

                "looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God"<br>
                Hebrews 12:2
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                No matter what you think about yourself, however much you hate yourself, if you can't love yourself, a man named Jesus loved you so much His body was ripped into shreds, blood gushing out, bones broken into pieces, suffocated, and suffered a humiliating death simply because He loves you. You are THAT joy that made it worth it for Him to suffer and die, and that will forever be a fact. Never let anyone in this world make you feel inferior or unloved or uncared for because that is not what Jesus showed.<br>God sees everything, and He truly knows everything. Everytime you are faithful and obedient in the little ways, that no one sees, God sees everything. He knows the truth, He sees through everything. There is comfort in knowing that we are seen and loved by God when no one else in the world may see it.

                "Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you."<br>
                Psalm 63:3
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Even though life is turbulent and God can feel distant at times, we praise God not for what He can do for us but for the steadfast love He has given. I learned that joy can be found in praising God and not to only praise Him when feeling joyful.

                “For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, not powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”<br>
                Romans 8:38-39
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                God's love is ever-present, ever-perfect, and everlasting! There is NOTHING that you or the world can do or say that could ever cause God to distance Himself from you. He is the perfect Father and Shepherd, tending to His flock and ensuring that His children are safe in His arms. A really good book I read last summer was Gentle and Lowly by Dane Ortlund. Through the book I was reminded that the heart of God is so tender for me, even in my sin, especially when I feel so far away from Him. What an amazing promise to uplift you when you feel far from Him!
