                “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” <br>
                1 Corinthians 13:7
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Love is such a hard thing to grasp, but when truly the sacrifice that God made through Jesus is known, that is when true joy and happiness comes, so always seek him out with everything no matter the season you are in, because He loves you guys!

                “...As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust...”<br>
                Psalm 103
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                For the moments that you think or feel that God turns his face away from you in anger, let these verses remind you that in our weaknesses (and we have many) that God looks on you with compassion. The whole Psalm 103 is great to read to understand the faithfulness of Gods love in our mess ups.

                “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!”<br>
                Psalm 139:23-24
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This verse struck me during a time when I couldn't fathom depth of Gods love. I see the Trust that David has with God to be willing to reveal himself to God, knowing His heart is Kind and motives towards us always pure. I hope this verse is a source of joy to those who want to hide from God, that God actually wants you to turn towards Him in your brokenness. The whole of Psalm 139 points to the unfailing love of God. I recommend it!
