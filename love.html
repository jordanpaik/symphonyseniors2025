                Love is such a hard thing to grasp, but when truly the sacrifice that God made through Jesus is known, that is when true joy and happiness comes, so always seek him out with everything no matter the season you are in, because He loves you guys!

                how great the Father's love for us! what on earth can overcome the power of the cross and the all mighty Lord of all creation? though the trials we face can be so consuming and fill our entire vision, I encourage you guys to look up to the heavens and see and know that the Lord's face is shining down upon you with all the love and grace he has in his heart.
