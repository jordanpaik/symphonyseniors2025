                “So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.”<br>
                1 Corinthians 3:7-9

                this verse helped me gain confidence when I started to lead fg. It is not me or the upperclassmen who came before me or the underclassmen who come after me that plant these seeds and make them grow. He who plants and waters are one! meaning God is doing it all by his hand and strength not us. all we have to do is surrender, obey, and be still in the places he is planting us to grow and serve.

                “The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.”<br>

                This verse came to me as a “verse of the day” after experiencing God's compassion on me. Practically and candidly speaking, I was low on money and wasn't sure I had enough to last me through the next week in Boston, but I sat down in resignation and put it in God's hand. I had the inclination to look in my bag for some mail I had collected recently, and could not believe it. In my bag was 7-8 checks that I never opened from the past few months of work! He provided SO abundantly! I waited and he was good to me. I hope this encourages others that God will be good to us in our need, we just have to wait.

                "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”"<br>

                Often times we are overwhelmed with how many things we have as college students. It really is so worth laying all these burdens down at Jesus' feet and resting in the knowledge that your burden is easy and your yoke is light when you carry your cross with the strength of God

                “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”<br>
                Matthew 11:28-30

                Life only gets busier but remember that God calls us to rest in Him because the greatest work of all was already finished through Christ so no matter the busy season, rest assured in Christs work done for you!
