                “So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.”<br>

                this verse helped me gain confidence when I started to lead fg. It is not me or the upperclassmen who came before me or the underclassmen who come after me that plant these seeds and make them grow. He who plants and waters are one! meaning God is doing it all by his hand and strength not us. all we have to do is surrender, obey, and be still in the places he is planting us to grow and serve.

                This verse is kind of mind boggling to me sometimes but reassuring in its own way. The reason I found it mind boggling was because it implies that things can happen by chance but God is in charge of that chance. I think it is reassuring though because it means even something as random as chance is intentional and sincere from God.
