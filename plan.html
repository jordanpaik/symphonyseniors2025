                “He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end."<br>

                In seasons of waiting, confusion, or desperation, this verse reminds me that God's plan is greater than anything I'm facing right now. I'm not meant to have it all figured out and I don't have to bear the weight of knowing everything. We are simply called to trust in the one who does because He promises us a future that is beautiful and beyond our understanding.

                In times of uncertainty/discouragement, this verse is a reminder that God has a promisingly bright and hopeful future planned for you! Your life is not meaningless/forgotten. Remember that God is not absent as He is always working. He has not and will not give up on you. Even if you currently don't understand it, trust in Him and He will lead you into His perfect plan. you got this i believe in you! :]

                I believe that God knows us better than we know ourselves. He knows what we need, He knows where we are, and He knows where we will go. In this verse, God shows that He has great plans for each of us, and even though sometimes we may be in tough situations, what is unexpected for us is not unknown to God. We can take comfort knowing that no matter what, God wants what is best for us and that His plans are always good.

                “Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."<br>
                Romans 8:26

            </p>
            <p class="description">
                When you feel lost and can't understand why, remember that God knows the reason. Keep praying, and trust that He is guiding you even when the path is unclear. In time, His plan will make sense, even if it feels hidden now.
