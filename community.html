                “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.”<br>
                1 Peter 4:8

            <p class="description">
                Having a more loving attitude towards others helped me grow so much throughout college.  Being more open and trying to love people allowed me to develop genuine relationships with sisters and brothers in the church and walking together with them has been such a blessing. Loving one another is sometimes hard but is important to hold on to because one act of love can come back to you ten times the amount you gave them. Loving others, as well as loving myself and God, helped strengthen my faith and I hope it does for you too.
